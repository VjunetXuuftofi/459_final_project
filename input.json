  "text": "He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at\nfive o’clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door.\n “Sorry,” he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds before\nMr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn’t seem at all upset at\nbeing almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said\nin a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, “Don’t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could\nupset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself\nshould be celebrating, this happy, happy day!”\n And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.\n Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also\nthought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car\nand set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because\nhe didn’t approve of imagination. ",
